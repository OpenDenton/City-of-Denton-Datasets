# City-of-Denton-Datasets
Issue tracker for City of Denton Datasets

## Purpose
This repo is meant to provide a collaborative way to assess and discuss the new datasets provided by the city of Denton. Using the built in CKAN API on their platform ([data.cityofdenton.com](data.cityofdenton.com)), we autogenerated issues for each dataset available. This gives us the ability to sort, discuss, and report back findings to the city technical staff on these datasets, not just to improve them for Open Data Day, but for all future open data purposes as well.

Inside each issue you will see some basic data about the dataset, a link to the dataset on the website, and a summary of the resources for each dataset.

### Issue / Data fetching script
If you want to play around, or even use this data script for something else, you can clone the repo and use composer to install the dependencies.

`$ git clone git@github.com:OpenDenton/City-of-Denton-Datasets.git`

If you don't have composer installed, download that first.

`$ brew install composer`

or

`$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php`

Then install the dependencies from the root of the repository.

```$ composer install```
